- 👋 Hi, I’m @FabiWenzel
- 👀 I’m interested in using Github in conjunction with R.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use Github in conjunction with R. Also, I am a redundant idiot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning Github in conjunction with R. Now I am even more redundant. You get he idea.
- 📫 I like this symbol as well, but I am currently hesitant about posting my personal information on Github. However, I do not know why, since my personal info is probably all over the web.
